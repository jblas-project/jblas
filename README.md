INSTALL

In principle, all you need is the jblas-1.2.0,jar in your
classpath. jblas-1.2.0.jar will then automagically extract your platform
dependent native library to a tempfile and load it from there. You can
also put that file somewhere in your load path ($LD_LIBRARY_PATH for
Linux, %PATH for Windows).


BUILDING

If you only work on the java part, an ant build.xml is provided to
recompile the sources. In addition to that you need an installation of
ruby for some scripts which automaticall generate code. Then, you just
type "ant" on the command line.

If you want to build jblas from the sources including the native part,
you need to set up quite a few things:

You will need some implementation of blas and lapack. jblas is tested
with either plain lapack, or ATLAS
(http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/). You also need the Fortran
sources for BLAS and LAPACK, available, for example from
http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapack-lite-3.1.1.tgz.

If you still want to build the source your own, see INSTALL for
further details.


HOW TO GET STARTED

Have a look at javadoc/index.html and
javadoc/org/jblas/DoubleMatrix.html

If you want to validate your installation and get some performance
numbers, try "java -server -jar jblas-1.2.0.jar", or drop the server
in case, you only have the "client" JVM installed.

register a ticket for them. Make sure to include as much information
as possible. For configuration problems it would also be helpful to
include the file "configure.log".
