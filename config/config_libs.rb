# Locating the libraries
#
# This is a bit involved since the standard ATLAS compilation produces
# a liblapack.so which only implements a subset of the lapack functions.
# So the basic strategy is to
#
# (a) find the path to the atlas specific library
# (b) find the path to a full lapack library
#
# Pass the lapack libraries and theirs paths first.
#
# Of course, if you want to build a lapack-only path, we only search
# for the full lapack libraries.
